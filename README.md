## Styling
This wiki is **community** based and maintained, that means it is in **your own** interest to keep is a high quality as possible, provide accurate, objective information and quality screenshots. 

We want the text to be as professional and unbiased as possible, but there is always room for some banter, just keep it civil. 

Divide your writings into paragraphs, and split the text using headings where appropriate. Use _styling_ **where** `acceptable` and needed. Familiarise yourself with [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github). If you happen to stumble upon a topic in your writing, that is quite comprehensive and extensice, consider creating completely new page for it, and linking that, so the guide won't be as long as the Great Chinese Wall. Few example guides to look at are [here](https://github.com/pwndevelopers/community-wiki/wiki/Building-your-first-budget-Pwnagotchi-using-RPi-0-W)...
